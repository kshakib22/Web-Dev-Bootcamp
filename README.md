# Web Development Bootcamp
This is my repository for progress on Angela Yu's bootcamp on web development on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). I start the code from Section 5 (where CSS starts) skipping the barebone HTML modules. The static site for most recent work at any given point is [here](https://kshakib22.github.io/Web-Dev-Bootcamp/)
